# ü™ê Saturn transiting ascendant

**In 2022, Saturn crossed my ascendant twice. The first time, before going, it went retrograde, I was in Dubai. I had two very impactful dreams about my past and my future, which helped me pursue my life objectives encoded on my north node.**

**Then, many months later, on the nights Saturn crossed my ascendant again, together with a retrograde mercury shadow in my 12th house, I dreamed about how I died in a past life. I dreamed about feeling at home in a place I had never been, with people I had never met. I felt the feeling of being happy. My death was through water; I don't need to tell more details. This might explain many facts in this current life, and the fact that my natal Neptune retrograde is strongly connected to my south node and moon.**&#x20;

**I believe retrogrades are just extra challenges in this game: we need to "revert" them during this life. I believe I have reverted my Neptune today.**

**Until this day, I did not really believe in reincarnation. Not the most logical explanation; I never found any supporting evidence. But after this dream and a series of other uncanny synchronicities, I am. a believer.**&#x20;

**This is the innermost spiritual effect of the transit. In parallel, Saturn crossing my ascendant during 2022 reflected into the outermost world as "growing up fast". I became certain of who I am and what I am not. I became stronger and more rigid. And this process didn't scary me too much.**

**Saturn is my strongest natal planet, so faith seems pretty strong in my life.**

**I am still investigating how Saturn acts on charts where it holds less authority.**
