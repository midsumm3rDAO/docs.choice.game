# ü™ê Saturn transiting ascendant

**In 2022, Saturn crossed my ascendant twice. The first time, before going, it went retrograde, I was in Dubai. I had two very impactful dreams about my past and my future, which helped me pursue my life objectives encoded on my north node.**\


**Then, many months later, on the nights Saturn crossed my ascendant again, I dreamed about how I had died in my past life. I dreamed about feeling at home in a place I had never been, with people I had never met. I felt the feeling of being happy. My death was through water; I don't need to tell more details. This might explain many facts in this current life, and my Neptune retrograde is strongly connected to my south node and moon. I believe retrogrades are just extra challenges in this game: we need to "revert" them during this life. I believe I have reverted my Neptune.**\


**Until this day, I did not really believe in reincarnation. Not the most logical explanation; I never found any supporting evidence. But after this dream and a series of other realizations and events, I believe.**\


**This is the innermost spiritual effect of the transit. In parallel, in the outermost world I grew up, I became certain of who I am and what I am not. I became stronger and more rigid. And this didn't scary me.**\


Saturn is my strongest planet, so faith is pretty strong in my life. I am still investigating how Saturn acts on charts where it holds less authority.
