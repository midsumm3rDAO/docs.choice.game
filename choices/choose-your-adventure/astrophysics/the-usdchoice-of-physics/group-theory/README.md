# ðŸ§¬ Group Theory

### <mark style="color:purple;">In the mathematics subfield of abstract algebra, group theory studies algebraic structures called (symmetry) groups.</mark>&#x20;

### <mark style="color:green;">Groups recur throughout mathematics and various physical systems</mark>&#x20;

### <mark style="color:green;">(e.g., the hydrogen atom, crystals,  public key cryptography, and three of the four known fundamental forces in the universe)</mark>&#x20;

### <mark style="color:green;">can be modeled by symmetry groups.</mark>&#x20;
